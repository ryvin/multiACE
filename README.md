# mUlt1ACE

Updates (past release)  (will be addressed in the next release)
- If the software is installed without an ACE connected, the ACE_MODE_NORMAL macro must be run before using the printer.
- Uninstalling leaves ace.py in the config folder. However, the file will not be loaded since it has been removed from printer.cfg.


## What's new in 0.81b

USB-level misbehaviour related to the ACE Pro's internal reset cycle could cause sporadic failures mid-print when switching between ACEs on every toolchange. This release works around it by keeping a single connection to the ACE that was active when the print started — the *start ACE* — and never disconnecting from it for the duration of the print.

**Trade-off:** during a print, only the start ACE has feed_assist available. Heads on other ACEs print without feed_assist; the extruder pulls the filament directly through the bowden. Validated through several hours of multi-color test prints without visible underextrusion. For unusually long bowden routing or high-friction filament, pick the start ACE deliberately with `ACE_SWITCH TARGET=N` so your most-used material lives on it. The next major version (v0.82) will lift this restriction.

**Bonus:** cross-ACE toolchanges no longer pay the ~5–10 second USB disconnect/reconnect cost.

**Logging:** dedicated state and USB debug logs were significantly expanded for post-mortem analysis after print issues (`state_debug` / `usb_debug` in `[ace]`).

## multiACE v0.81b "First Light" Hotfix 1

**Multi-ACE Pro support for Snapmaker U1 with Klipper**

> ⚠️ **Beta Software** - This is a community-driven development project for enabling multiple Anycubic ACE Pro filament changers on Snapmaker printers. While carefully tested, it relies on community feedback and testing to mature. Use at your own risk. Please report issues and share your experience to help improve multiACE for everyone.

> **Important Note:** Both the Snapmaker U1 and the Anycubic ACE Pro have their own quirks with filament loading/unloading, RFID detection (possibly related to tag sticker positioning), and occasional mechanical issues. Not every problem encountered is a multiACE issue - many are inherent to the underlying hardware. This is a beta release, not a production-ready solution. Whether these U1 and ACE Pro limitations can be resolved in the future remains to be seen.

## What is multiACE?

multiACE extends the [SnapACE](https://github.com/BlackFrogKok/SnapACE) software to support **multiple ACE Pro units** on a single Snapmaker U1 printer. Switch between ACE units to use different filament sets - for example, PLA on ACE 0 and PETG on ACE 1 - without physically swapping spools.

## Typical Workflow

### Single Material (e.g. PLA on ACE 0)

1. Insert spools into ACE 0
2. Press **ACEB__Load_0** → loads all filled slots
3. Print normally

### Multiple Materials (e.g. PLA on ACE 0, PETG on ACE 1)

1. Insert PLA spools into ACE 0, PETG spools into ACE 1
2. Load PLA toolheads (T0-T2) via display
3. Press **ACEA__Switch_1** → switch to ACE 1
4. Load PETG into desired toolhead (e.g. T3) via display or **ACEC__Load_T3**
5. Toolchanges during print automatically switch between ACEs

### Switching Complete Filament Sets

1. Press **ACEC__Unload_All** → unloads everything
2. Press **ACEB__Load_1** → switch to ACE 1 and load all

### Switching ACE Units

Use the Fluidd macros **ACEA__Switch_0..3** to switch between ACE units.

> **Note on macro names:** The macro names use letter prefixes (ACEA, ACEB, ACEC...) to ensure they appear in a logical order in Fluidd's alphabetical macro list. If you prefer different names, you can rename them anytime in `config/extended/ace.cfg`.

## Features

- **Multi-ACE Support** - Connect up to 4 ACE Pro units simultaneously
- **ACE Switching** - Switch between ACE units via Fluidd macros or console
- **Auto-Load** - Load all filled slots from selected ACE with one command
- **Unload All** - Unload all toolheads, automatically switching to correct ACE for retract
- **RFID Handling** - Automatic RFID detection and display across ACE switches
- **Manual Filament Support** - Works with both RFID and non-RFID spools
- **Per-ACE Dryer Settings** - Configurable temperature and duration per ACE
- **Normal Mode** - Switch back to stock Snapmaker operation at any time (only original files active, no ACE code running). Useful for filaments the ACE Pro cannot handle, such as TPU/TPE
- **Auto-Feed Control** - Automatic during print, disabled outside print to prevent unwanted preloads
- **Print-Start Safety Check** - Warns if a needed ACE is offline
- **PAXX Firmware Compatible** - Works with PAXX firmware which provides display mirroring, allowing full load/unload control from your computer
- **Clean Install/Uninstall** - One-command scripts with automatic backup and restore

## Web Console (optional)

multiACE includes an optional web console at `http://<printer-ip>/multiace/`. The Dashboard is the home view — it shows print state (filename, progress, layer, ETA, Pause/Resume/Cancel), filament grid (4 toolheads with color band, source slot, status), an ACE slots strip, recent activity, and the dryer status when one is running. Other tabs cover the full activity log, dryer profiles (PLA / PETG / TPU / ABS / Nylon / PC / PVA + Custom), inline `ace.cfg` editor, and diagnostics.

The console also surfaces:

- The U1's enclosure cavity temperature (free, from Klipper).
- An optional external humidity sensor (SwitchBot, Govee, Home Assistant entity, or any HTTP/JSON source — see `multiace_web/docs/hardware-bluetooth.md`).
- Per-filament dryer profiles with parameterized `ACE_DRY` commands so you can dry while a print runs (capped at safe-during-print temps per material).

Mobile-responsive (works on phones); no Fluidd plugin needed. Dark mode automatic.

The console installs automatically when you run `install_multiace.sh`. See `multiace_web/README.md` for the architecture overview and `multiace_web/docs/` for:

- `dashboard-guide.md` — section-by-section walkthrough
- `api-reference.md` — every endpoint, with curl examples
- `hardware-bluetooth.md` — wiring a Govee BLE sensor + USB BT dongle for humidity-driven monitoring
- `auto-dry-design.md` — design notes for the upcoming humidity-driven auto-dry FSM

## Requirements

- Snapmaker U1 printer
- Snapmaker firmware or PAXX firmware (tested with Snapmaker 1.2 and PAXX 12-14)
- 1-4 Anycubic ACE Pro units connected via USB (tested with 3)
- SSH access to the printer
- Fluidd web interface
- PTFE tube splitters (1-to-N per toolhead) - also allows switching to Normal Mode without recabling

## Hardware Setup

### Cable Building Guide (Solder-Free)

The ACE Pro connects to the Snapmaker U1 via USB using a Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 connector. No soldering required.

**What You Need:**
- 1x Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 Male 2x3 connector with pre-crimped wires - [AliExpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005010370245711.html)
- 1x USB Type-A screw terminal adapter - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0825TWRW7)

**Pinout:**

```
ACE Pro Molex (2x3) - front view          Connection
         ||  <- clip
   ┌────────────┐
   │ [1] [2] [3] │                        Pin 2 (D-)  -> USB D-
   │ [4] [5] [6] │                        Pin 3 (D+)  -> USB D+
   └────────────┘                         Pin 5 (GND) -> USB GND
                                          Pin 6 (VCC) -> NOT CONNECTED
```

Refer to the [SnapAce pinout diagram](https://github.com/BlackFrogKok/SnapAce/blob/main/.github/img/pinout.png) for the exact Molex pin positions.

> **Important:** Pin 6 (VCC) is not connected - the ACE Pro has its own power supply. Can be dangerous for your printer. Molex cables have no standardized color coding. Always measure continuity before connecting.

**Assembly:**
1. Connect D-, D+, and GND from the Molex connector to D-, D+, and GND on the USB connector
2. Twist D+ and D- wires together (2-3 twists per cm) to reduce electromagnetic interference
3. If using a cut USB cable: wrap the exposed section with aluminum foil overlapping the cable shield
4. Additional ACE units connect via the daisy chain cable (included with ACE Pro) - no additional USB cables needed for units 2+

### ACE Connection Overview

Each ACE Pro connects to the printer via **two interfaces**:
- **USB** - Serial communication (commands, status, RFID)
- **PTFE tubes** - Filament path from ACE slots to toolheads

All ACE units are wired **in parallel** - each ACE slot feeds the **same toolhead** as the corresponding slot on every other ACE. This allows switching entire filament sets by switching the active ACE.

```
                    Splitter
ACE 0  Slot 0 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 0 ──────┤──── Head 0 (T0)
ACE 2  Slot 0 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 1 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 1 ──────┤──── Head 1 (T1)
ACE 2  Slot 1 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 2 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 2 ──────┤──── Head 2 (T2)
ACE 2  Slot 2 ──────┘

ACE 0  Slot 3 ──────┐
ACE 1  Slot 3 ──────┤──── Head 3 (T3)
ACE 2  Slot 3 ──────┘
```

### USB Connection

Each ACE Pro connects to the Snapmaker U1 via USB (data only - each ACE has its own power supply). The ACE units are daisy-chained through the USB ports on the back of each ACE:

```
Snapmaker U1 USB Port
        │
      ACE 0 ─── ACE 1 ─── ACE 2 ─── ACE 3
       (USB out → USB in, daisy chain)
```

> **Note:** VCC (5V) is not connected in the USB cable - only data lines. Each ACE Pro is powered by its own external power supply.

multiACE detects ACE units automatically by USB vendor/product ID (28e9:018a). The order of the daisy chain determines the ACE index (0, 1, 2, 3).

### PTFE Tube Splitters

Each toolhead needs a **splitter** that merges PTFE tubes from multiple ACE units into a single path to the extruder. With splitters installed, you can switch between ACE units **and** back to Normal Mode (stock feeders) without recabling.

- **3D print** a Y-splitter or multi-way splitter
- **Use commercial** PTFE tube connectors with multiple inputs

> **Tip:** Keep all PTFE tube lengths as equal as possible between ACE units. Adjust `load_length` per toolhead in `ace.cfg` if needed.

### RFID Spool Tags

The ACE Pro reads RFID tags from Anycubic spools to automatically detect filament type, color, and brand. For third-party spools without RFID, you can write compatible tags yourself:

- **Tags** - Use NFC NTAG 213 or 215 stickers
- **iPhone** - TagMySpool app
- **Android** - RFID ACE app

Spools without RFID tags work fine - you can set the filament type and color manually via the Snapmaker display.

### Recommended Setup

| ACE Units | Use Case | Setup |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 2 ACEs | Material switching (e.g. PLA + PETG) | 2-way splitters, direct USB |
| 2 ACEs | Extended color range (8 colors) | 2-way splitters, direct USB |
| 3-4 ACEs | Multi-material + colors | N-way splitters, USB hub |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing multiACE, ensure the following:

1. **Firmware** - Install Snapmaker firmware 1.2+ or PAXX firmware 12-14 on your Snapmaker U1
2. **Enable Root Access** - On the Snapmaker display, go to Settings > About > tap firmware version 10 times to unlock Advanced Mode, then enable Root Access
3. **Enable SSH** - Connect via SSH or serial console and run:
   ```
   touch /oem/.debug
   ```
   After reboot, Wi-Fi password needs to be re-entered on the display. SSH is then available at `root@<printer-ip>`
4. **Verify SSH** - Connect from your computer:
   ```
   ssh root@<printer-ip>
   ```

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Copy the `multiace/` folder to your printer via SCP/SFTP (e.g. WinSCP on Windows, or command line):
   ```
   scp -r multiace/ root@<printer-ip>:/tmp/multiace/
   ```
3. SSH into the printer and run:
   ```
   bash /tmp/multiace/install_multiace.sh
   ```
4. Reboot the printer
5. multiACE starts in **Multi mode** - all connected ACE units are detected automatically

### Manual Install

If you prefer manual installation:

1. Copy Klipper extras to the printer:
   ```
   cp klipper/extras/ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/extras/filament_feed_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/extras/filament_switch_sensor_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/
   cp klipper/kinematics/extruder_ace.py /home/lava/klipper/klippy/kinematics/
   ```

2. Copy config files:
   ```
   cp config/extended/ace.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/
   mkdir -p /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace
   cp config/extended/multiace/ace_vars.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/
   cp config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/
   chmod +x /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh
   ```

3. Activate ACE file swap:
   ```
   bash /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/ace_mode_switch.sh ace
   ```

4. Delete Python cache:
   ```
   rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/__pycache__/
   rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/kinematics/__pycache__/
   ```

5. Reboot the printer

### Uninstall

Run the uninstall script (installed automatically to the printer):
```
bash /home/lava/printer_data/config/extended/multiace/uninstall_multiace.sh
```

Or from the install folder:
```
bash /tmp/multiace/uninstall_multiace.sh
```

Then reboot. The printer returns to stock operation.

## Fluidd Macros

| **ACEE__Autofeed_Off/ON** | Disable/enable auto-feed |
| **ACEF__Mode_Normal** | Switch to stock mode (no ACE) |
| **ACEF__Mode_Multi** | Switch to multi-ACE mode |

## Configuration

All settings are in `config/extended/ace.cfg` under the `[ace]` section:

```ini
[ace]

# Number of physically connected ACE Pro devices.
# Default 1 (single ACE — no config change needed). REQUIRED for
# multi-ACE setups (>1): set to your physical count (2..8). At
# startup, multiACE waits up to 20s for all expected devices to
# appear, then locks the path-to-index mapping for the rest of
# the session so a temporarily missing ACE during a USB reset
# cycle never causes index drift.
# ace_device_count: 3

# Logging
# log_dir: /home/lava/printer_data/logs   # default — usually fine
state_debug: true       # per-toolchange / per-load audit log
usb_debug: true         # per-scan / per-connect serial-layer log

# Serial
baud: 115200

# ACE feed/retract settings
feed_speed: 80          # Feed speed (mm/s)
retract_speed: 30       # Retract speed (mm/s, lower = cleaner winding)
retract_length: 1950    # Distance from extruder to splitter (mm)
load_length: 2100       # ACE feed distance for load (mm)

# feed_length: distance for the filament to reach the toolhead.
# ACE has its own loading procedure and this length does not affect
# it. Pick a value so that after ACE loading the filament is ~5-6 cm
# away from the toolhead. Set to 0 to disable (recommended; the
# preload phase wastes time and gives inconsistent positions).
feed_length: 0

# Retry settings
load_retry: 1           # Number of load retries
load_retry_retract: 50  # Mini-retract before retry (mm)

# Temperature

```

### Configuration Recommendations

**ace_device_count** - Default `1`. **Required for multi-ACE setups**: uncomment and set to your physical ACE count (2..8). The 20s startup wait ensures all devices are detected even if some happen to be mid USB reset cycle when Klipper boots. Without an explicit count, multi-ACE setups risk locking the canonical mapping with one device missing.

**state_debug / usb_debug** - Default `true`. Keep enabled. These dedicated logs (separate from `klippy.log`) capture per-toolchange audit entries and serial-layer events. Essential for post-mortem analysis after print issues. Negligible runtime overhead.

**feed_length** - Set to `0` (disabled). The preload phase wastes time when loading ACE slots and leads to inconsistent filament positions in the PTFE tubes.

**load_length** - Set to approximately **110% of your actual PTFE tube length** (from ACE to splitter). The load phase is sensor-controlled and will stop when filament is detected, so a longer value is safe and ensures reliable loading.

**retract_speed** - Keep low (default `30`). The ACE Pro sometimes winds filament loosely at higher speeds, causing tangles on the spool. Additionally, consider printing a spool guide upgrade such as [this ACE Pro roller guide](https://www.printables.com/model/1237589-20-anycubic-ace-pro-upgrade-kit-to-new-s1-version) to improve winding quality.

**retract_length** - Measure the actual distance from your extruder sensor to the PTFE splitter and subtract ~100mm. The retract only needs to pull the filament back past the splitter junction, not the full tube length.

## Known Limitations

- **Unload before first use** - After a fresh install or when upgrading from a previous version, unload all toolheads before using multiACE. Filament loaded from a previous installation may cause unexpected behavior since multiACE has no knowledge of the previous state. Use **ACEC__Unload_All** or unload via display before starting.
- **Cross-ACE feed_assist** - During a print, only the ACE that was active when the print started has feed_assist available. Toolchanges to heads on other ACEs print without feed_assist (extruder pulls filament directly through the bowden). Pick the start ACE deliberately with `ACE_SWITCH TARGET=N` before the print so your most-used material lives on it. The next major version (v0.82) will lift this restriction.
- **ACE USB Reset** - Inactive ACE units periodically reset their USB connection (~3s cycle). This is normal ACE Pro firmware behavior and does not affect operation. Visible in `dmesg` but harmless.
- **Display Attach Toolhead** - Attaching a toolhead via the Snapmaker display triggers auto-feed. This is stock Snapmaker behavior and cannot be suppressed.
- **Unload All clears display** - After **ACEC__Unload_All**, manually set filament types and colors are cleared. This is by design - reload and set filament info again after unload.
- **load / feed_length per toolhead only** - Will be adressed in next version, set settings to longest path length, sensors check shoukd stop it.

## Troubleshooting

### Reset to clean state

If things get out of sync (wrong filament displayed, unexpected behavior), reset everything:

1. Unload all toolheads via display (make sure no filament is stuck in any head)
2. In Fluidd console: `ACE_CLEAR_HEADS`
3. Power-cycle the printer (full off/on, not just Klipper restart)
4. After reboot, start fresh with loading from ACE 0

### Klipper won't start after install
- Check if `ace.cfg` is included: `grep ace.cfg /home/lava/printer_data/config/printer.cfg`
- Check if `multiace/ace_vars.cfg` exists
- Run uninstall and reinstall

### ACE not detected
- Check USB connection: `ls /dev/serial/by-path/`
- ACE Pro should show as vendor `28e9`, product `018a`
- Try power-cycling the ACE

### Old code running despite update
- Delete Python cache: `rm -rf /home/lava/klipper/klippy/extras/__pycache__/`
- Check file timestamp in console: `multiACE v0.80b (file: ...)`

### Serial errors on console
- Serial errors during ACE switch are logged silently. If errors persist, check USB cables.

### Serial errors on console
- Serial errors during ACE switch are logged silently. If errors persist, check USB cables.

### Reporting issues

When reporting a problem, please include the following logs from your printer. They are essential for diagnosing the issue:

1. **multiACE state log** — per-action audit trail (toolchanges, loads, unloads, FA events):
   ```
   cat /home/lava/printer_data/logs/multiace_state.log
   ```
2. **multiACE USB log** — serial connect/disconnect and scan events:
   ```
   cat /home/lava/printer_data/logs/multiace_usb.log
   ```
3. **Klipper log** — the last ~200 lines around the time of the issue:
   ```
   tail -200 /home/lava/printer_data/logs/klippy.log
   ```

Also mention:
- **Time of error** — exact timestamp so we can find it in the logs
- **What you did** — which button / macro / gcode you triggered
- **What happened before** — was this mid-print, during load, after a restart, etc.
- **Expected behavior** — what should have happened instead
- How many ACE units you have connected
- Whether your spools have RFID tags or not

## Roadmap

### Next Version
- Bug fixes based on community feedback
- Custom Fluidd UI panel for ACE management
- Maybe one day: [Full vision](https://youtube.com/video/gJVQikjtDNs)
